# "url": link to send the message. Only this needs to and must be specified manually.
# The plugin will send a message there every time the server start / stops, plugin reloads / shuts down,
# or when a server-wide chat event (player joins/quits, chats, advancements, /say command) takes place.

# Arguments to be used in all configurations except "destination":
# {player} = player name; {chat} = chat message; {advancement} = advancement; {version} = plugin version.

# However, only {message} (as the *full message* of all other configurations) can be used in "destination". 
# There are three methods available: get, post-form, post-json. Any other methods default to "get".
# When using post methods you also need to specify the "post-data".

# Example url (get method): 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/send_msg?msg={message}&from=plugin'
# Example post-data (post-json method): '{"msg": "{message}"}'
# Example chat: '<{player}> {chat}'

# Note: white space characters on both side of messages will be removed.
# If your custom message contains special characters, quote the entire message with quotation marks.

# These settings only affect messages posted to the destination. Messages in-game / in the console will never change.

# "say-command" and "me-command" stand for the message-broadcasting /say and /me command. 
# It does not necessarily need to be regarded as a player chat message; here the {player}/{chat} is used for convenience.

# Due to the way death events are implemented in the API, it is not easy to modify the message; 
# better to leave it as-is.
