# SendChat

A plugin that sends server stat/stop, player join/quit, chat messages, and advancement messages on a Minecraft Spigot server to a specific web page.

This can be used with a local api to post messages on other platforms.

## Requirement

This plugin requires Spigot servers (forks like Paper are fine) running at least Java 11 (due to the *HttpClient* used). 

## Configuration

***WIP***. For plugin configuration, see [config.yml](src/main/resources/config.yml).
