# SendChat

A plugin that sends server start/stop, player join/quit, chat, and advancement messages from a Minecraft Spigot server to a specific web page.

This can be used with an API running locally to send messages and post on other platforms.

*Please note that this plugin is in its initial stage and thus many important features are yet to be developed. Stability issues may occur.*

## Requirement

This plugin requires **1.16.4 Spigot** servers (forks such as Paper are fine). 

## Configuration

***WIP***. For plugin configuration, see [**config.yml**](src/main/resources/config.yml).
