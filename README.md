# SendChat

A plugin that sends server start/stop, player join/quit, chat, and advancement messages on a Minecraft Spigot server to a specific web page.

This can be used with a local api to post messages on other platforms.

*Please note that this plugin is in its initial development stage and thus lacks many important features. Stability issues may frequently occur.*

## Requirement

This plugin requires **1.16.4 Spigot** servers (forks such as Paper are fine) running at least **Java 11** (due to the *HttpClient* used). 

## Configuration

***WIP***. For plugin configuration, see [**config.yml**](src/main/resources/config.yml).
